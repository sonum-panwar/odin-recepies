    <p>When you want to make a treat that’s really on another delicious level, there’s one ingredient you can always count on: Nutella®! Everybody’s favorite hazelnut-chocolate spread has long been making desserts extra special.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 to 14 tablespoons Nutella</li>
        <li>1-½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spoon 1-½ tablespoons of Nutella® onto the prepared pan. Spread it out into a round disc about 2-½ inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Repeat, making 7 to 8 Nutella® discs. Place the pan in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the Nutella® discs are firm and hold their shape.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large skillet or griddle to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the egg, vanilla extract and milk.</li>
        <li>Mix the pancake batter until fully blended.</li>
        <li>Spray the preheated griddle with pan spray, and wipe away excess.</li>
        <li>Pour ¼ cup of the pancake batter on the prepared griddle. Place 1 frozen Nutella® disc into the center of the batter.</li>
        <li>Top the Nutella® disc with enough batter to cover completely. When the batter begins to bubble the pancake is ready to be flipped.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook the pancake for an additional 1 to 2 minutes, or until the other side is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Keep the completed pancakes warm while preparing the remaining pancakes. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
